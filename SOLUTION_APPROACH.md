# Solution Approach

## Overview

Hey there! In this document, I'll walk you through the thought process and steps behind the development of the "Querying-CSVs-and-Plot-Graphs-with-LLMs" application. I hope this document gives you a clear and friendly understanding of how this app came together.

## Steps

1. **Understanding the Problem and Gathering Requirements**
    - First things first, I needed to grasp what this application was supposed to do. 
    - The key features were clear: uploading CSV files, preprocessing data, performing statistical analysis, generating insights with AI, creating custom visualizations, and having an interactive Q&A feature.

2. **Choosing the Technology Stack**
    - Next up was picking the right tools for the job:
        - **Streamlit**: Perfect for building the web interface.
        - **Pandas**: Great for handling and analyzing data.
        - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Ideal for creating beautiful and informative plots.
        - **LangChain & Google Generative AI**: For those smart AI-driven insights and interactions.

3. **Structuring the Application**
    - I set up a clean layout using Streamlit:
        - A sidebar for uploading files and configuring settings.
        - A main area with tabs for different functions (like Data Summary, Insights, Custom Visualization, and Q&A).

4. **Handling CSV File Upload and Preprocessing**
    - Added a file uploader in Streamlit to let users choose their CSV files.
    - Loaded the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame and took care of data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and adjusting data types.

5. **Summarizing Data and Conducting Statistical Analysis**
    - Displayed the first few rows of the data for a quick look.
    - Provided summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
    - Created and showed a correlation heatmap to reveal relationships between variables.

6. **Generating AI-Powered Insights and Visualizations**
    - Leveraged LangChain and Google Generative AI to come up with insights.
    - Crafted prompts to guide the AI in analyzing data and suggesting visualizations.
    - Ran the AI's code to produce the suggested plots.

7. **Creating Custom Visualizations**
    - Gave users the option to build their own plots by selecting columns and plot types.
    - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate and display these custom visualizations.

8. **Adding Interactive Q&A with the Dataset**
    - Added a feature where users can ask questions about their data.
    - Used the AI model to provide answers and displayed these responses in an easy-to-understand format.

9. **Testing and Validation**
    - Tested the app with a variety of CSV files to ensure it works smoothly.
    - Checked the accuracy of AI-generated insights and visualizations. 
    - Made sure to manage environment variables securely, especially the Google API key.

## Conclusion

And thatâ€™s a wrap! The "Querying-CSVs-and-Plot-Graphs-with-LLMs" app is designed to make data analysis and visualization a breeze. With the power of AI and some nifty visual tools, users can effortlessly gain insights from their data.
